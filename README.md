# Using Github as an IIIF Image Repository

[IIIF](https://iiif.io) is a set of open standards for delivering high-quality, attributed digital objects online at scale. Itâ€™s also an international community developing and implementing the IIIF APIs. IIIF is backed by a consortium of leading cultural institutions.

This document describes an approach for hosting IIIF images in a Github repository.  In this approach images and IIIF properties files are stored in a Github repository and served by an external service that dynamically generates IIIF presentation manifests and serves IIIF image tiles from the Github content.  The metadata in this repository are used to generate manifest files that are compliant with the [IIIF Presentation API 3.0](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/).

Where possible, purpose-built image sharing sites should be used for hosting and sharing image files.  [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is one such (free-to-use) site for hosting and sharing media files.  While Wikimedia Commons (and some other file sharing sites) do not yet support IIIF, the same service that is used to generate IIIF manifests and serve images from Github repositories also works with many of these sites.  The advantage of using images stored on a site like Wikimedia Commons is that IIIF manifests can be automatically generated using metadata obtained from Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provided by the sites.

As an example, an IIIF manifest for the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:White-cheeked_Honeyeater_-_Maddens_Plains.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:White-cheeked_Honeyeater_-_Maddens_Plains.jpg) image hosted by Wikimedia Commons is automatically generated using the URL [https://iiif.visual-essays.net/wc:White-cheeked_Honeyeater_-_Maddens_Plains.jpg/manifest.json](https://iiif.visual-essays.net/wc:White-cheeked_Honeyeater_-_Maddens_Plains.jpg/manifest.json).  Using the auto-generated IIIF manifest the image can easily be viewed in an IIIF compatible viewer or used by IIIF tools.  The White-cheeked Honeyeater image can be seen in the iiif.visual-essays.net image viewer at [https://iiif.visual-essays.net/wc:White-cheeked_Honeyeater_-_Maddens_Plains.jpg](https://iiif.visual-essays.net/wc:White-cheeked_Honeyeater_-_Maddens_Plains.jpg)

In many cases a minimal set of IIIF required metadata for a single image can be generated from site-wide default values and image-specific metadata that can be inferred from the image file name (such as the image title and reuse rights code).

In situations where more descriptive metadata is needed a simple key-value properties file can be associated with a single image or a group of images located in a folder.

# Options for image and/or metadata hosting

## Image only

The easiest method for hosting a IIIF image file in a Github repository is to use a simple file naming convention that is used to define the image label and an optional reuse rights code.  This represents the minimal user-defined metadata to create a valid IIIF manifest.  When a rights code is ommitted from the file name the value `InC` (In copyright) is used as a default and the owner of the Github repository hosting the image is assumed to be the image owner.

The convention splits the file name into 2 segments that are separated by the first dash (`-`) character found in the name.  The characters in the first  segment are used for the image label in the generated IIIF manifest after replacing all underscore (`_`) characters with spaces.  The text in the second segment represent the reuse rights code to be associated with the image.  The reuse rights code will be transformed into a full URL as required by the IIIF manifest.

In cases where multiple images in the same folder need to use the same label a double underscore (`__`) can be used to signify the end of a label and the start of some arbitray text that results in a unique file name.  The text after the double underscore but before the first dash is not included in the generated label.  For instance, file names like `Some_label__1-CC0.jpg` and `Some_label__2-CC0.jpg` could be used to create a unique file name for images that share a label and rights code.

The reuse rights for an image is defined by appending a Creative Commons or Rights Statements code to the end of the file name (but before the file extension).  The reuse rights code must be one of the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) or [RightsStatements.org](https://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/) codes defined in [Reuse Rights](#reuse-rights) section below.  If a rights code is not provided in the file name a default value is used.  The default value is obtained from properties files found in the folder hierarchy in which the image file is located.  If rights metadata is available in multiple properties files the value in the file that is closest to the image takes precedence.  For instance, if a properties file at the root of the repository defined the reuse rights as `CC BY` and then another properties file in a parent/ancestor folder of the image defined the reuse rights as `CC BY-SA`, the `CC BY SA` value would take precedence and would be used in the generated IIIF manifest.  If not properties files are found in the image folder hierarchy a default value of `InC` is used.

### Examples

- The file name for the image [Fallstaff_Hotel_and_Westgate_Towers,_Canterbury-CC0.jpg](Fallstaff_Hotel_and_Westgate_Towers,_Canterbury-CC0.jpg) is formatted to enable a label and rights statement to be extracted without the need for a separate properties file.
  - The IIIF manifest generated for this image can be seen at [https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Fallstaff_Hotel_and_Westgate_Towers,_Canterbury-CC0.jpg/manifest.json](https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Fallstaff_Hotel_and_Westgate_Towers,_Canterbury-CC0.jpg/manifest.json).
  - This manifest can then be used in any IIIF viewer to view the image.  For instance, using the iiif.visual-essays.net viewer [https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Fallstaff_Hotel_and_Westgate_Towers,_Canterbury-CC0.jpg](https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Fallstaff_Hotel_and_Westgate_Towers,_Canterbury-CC0.jpg).

## Image and properties file

In situations where it is desired to associate richer metadata with an image a supplemental properties file may be used.

### Examples

- The image [Dane_John_Park.jpg](Dane_John_Park.jpg) is accompanied with the [Dane_John_Park.yaml](Dane_John_Park.yaml) properties file which includes a summary, date, and Wikidata QID (in the `depicts` metadata field).
  - The IIIF manifest for this image can be seen at [https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Dane_John_Park.jpg/manifest.json](https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Dane_John_Park/manifest.json).
  - The image can be viewed in the iiif.visual-essays.net image viewer at [https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Dane_John_Park.jpg](https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Dane_John_Park.jpg).

> Where possible, it is recommended to include the `depicts` metadata property to identify entities depicted in the image.  In this example the included Wikidata QID ([Q16988443](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16988443)) indicates that the [Dane John Mound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dane_John_Mound) is depicted in the image.

## Properties file only

In situations where an image is hosted on another web site that does not provide a IIIF manifest a properties file is used to define the IIIF metadata in a generated IIIF manifest.  When using this method the URL to the externally hosted image is included in the properties file in addition to the usual IIIF metadata properties.

### Examples

- [Canterbury_Cathedral_2021.yaml](Canterbury_Cathedral_2021.yaml)
  - Generated manifest: [https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Canterbury_Cathedral_2021/manifest.json](https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Canterbury_Cathedral_2021/manifest.json)
  - Image viewer URL: [https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Canterbury_Cathedral_2021](https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Canterbury_Cathedral_2021)
- [Canterbury_Cathedral_circa_1905.yaml](Canterbury_Cathedral_circa_1905.yaml)
  - Generated manifest: [https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Canterbury_Cathedral_circa_1905/manifest.json](https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Canterbury_Cathedral_circa_1905/manifest.json)
  - Image viewer URL: [https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Canterbury_Cathedral_circa_1905](https://iiif.visual-essays.net/gh:kent-map/images/Canterbury_Cathedral_circa_1905)

# Reuse Rights

The IIIF Presentation Manifests provide a flexible approach for explicitly defining the reuse rights for an image and any attribution (or other) statements that must be displayed when the image is used.

`Rights` refers string that identifies a license or rights statement that applies to the content of the resource, such as the JSON of a Manifest or the pixels of an image. The value must be drawn from the set of [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license URIs or [RightsStatements.org](https://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/) rights statement URIs

# Defining rights

## Using a file naming convention

The easiest method for defining the rights for an image hosted in Github is to append a Creative Commons or Rights Statements code to the end (but before the file extension) of the Github file name.  The naming convention recognized by the Visual Essays IIIF manifest generator splits the file name into two segments.  The segments are separated by the first `-` found in the file name.  The first segment is the image label (or caption) and the second is the rights code.  The rights code is one of the Creative Commons or RightsStatements.org codes defined in the section above.

The text before the first `-` character in the file name is used to create the image label/caption unless this is overridden by a label property in an image-specific properties (`.yaml`) file.  When using the first segment from the file name for the label, any underscore (`_`) characters are converted to spaces.  A double underscore (`__`) can be used to signify the end of a title.  This can be useful if multiple images in a folder will use the same label.  For instance, `Some_label__1-CC0.jpg` and `Some_label__2-CC0.jpg`.  In this example both image files have a unique file name but can be associated with the same label and rights code.

## Using metadata files

An alternative to adding the rights code to the file name is to associate a metadata file with an image.  The metadata file approach provides a mechanism for defining a wide range of attributes for an image.  A metadata file can be associated with a single image or all images contained in a folder.

### Associating metadata with a single image

Metadata can be associated with a single image by creating a `.yaml` file with the same root file name as the image but with the `.yaml` extension instead of the image extension (typically `.jpg` or `.png`).  For instance, to associate a metadata file with the image named `Fiordo_de_Furore.jpg` the file `Fiordo_de_Furore.yaml` would be created in the same directory. 

### Associating metadata with multiple images

Metadata can be associated with multiple files by grouping the files in a folder and adding a `metadata.yaml` file in the same folder.

# Image metadata file format

Metadata files for single images or groups of images in a folder follow the structure defined for the [IIIF Presentation API v3.0](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#42-resource-representations).  The [iiif-props.template.yaml][iiif-props.template.yaml] can be copied and used as a starter for folder or image-level properties. 

# Using a metadata file for external files

In addition to defining metadata for files hosted in Github, metadata files may also be used to associate metadata (for manifest generation) with files hosted on other sites.  An example of this can be seen with the [Westgate_today.yaml][images/kent-maps/Westgate_today.yaml] file.
